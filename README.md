# hello_world
this is my hello_world repository.

hello champs,
This is my first repository on github though quite a lame one, I know. But I am learning to be a better programmer.
I always believed in a quote,"You are not your job, you're not how much money you have in the bank. You are not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You are not your fucking khakis. You are all singing, all dancing crap of the world.‚Äù

Thank you for reading,
